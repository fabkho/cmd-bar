# Data Structure

Commands are represented as an array of `Command` objects. A `Command` object must at least have an `id` and a `label` property. Here is an example:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const commands: Command[] = [
  {
    id: '1',
    label: 'Command 1',
  },
  {
    id: '2',
    label: 'Command 2',
  },
  {
    id: '3',
    label: 'Command 3',
  },
]
</script>

<template>
  <CmdBar :commands="[{key: 'people', commands: 'people'}]" />
</template>
```
