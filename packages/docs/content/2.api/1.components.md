# Components

Discover every provided component. 


## `<CmdBar />`
Is the **main** component of this library. It is used to Provide the data to the other components. It takes the following props:
- `commands`: An array of `Group` objects. (See [Group](#types/group))

## `<CmdBar.Dialog />`
Uses the HTML `<dialog>` element to display the command bar. It takes the following props:
- `visible`: Whether the command bar is visible or not. (Default: `false`)

Inside the `CmdBar.Dialog` component, you can use the following slots:
- `header`: The header of the dialog.
- `content`: The content of the dialog.
- `footer`: The footer of the dialog.

::alert{type="info"}
This is completely **optional**, you can use your **own modal system**. But if you want to use the built-in solution, which handles everything out of the box, you can use this component.

## `<CmdBar.Input />`
Provides an input to search through the commands. It takes the following props:
- `placeholder`: The placeholder of the input. (Default: `Search for anything`)
- `modelValue`: The value of the input. (Default: `''`)

<!-- implement -->
- `debounce`: Debounce of the input. (Default: `300`)

<!-- is this even needed? -->
- `fuseOptions`: The fuse options of the input. (Default: `{ includeMatches: true, keys: ['commands.label'] }`)
## `<CmdBar.Filter />`
Built-in solution to filter the commands. It takes the following props:
- `defaultFilterOption`: pre-selected filter option. If a key is provided, which is not in the `commands` array, it will be handled as an "all" filter. (Example: )
- `asCheckbox`: Wether it should be possible to select multiple options or not. (Default: `false`)

## `<CmdBar.List />`
To ensure great performance and scalability, the `CmdBarList` component uses [useVirtualList](https://vueuse.org/core/useVirtualList/#usevirtuallist) under the hood, to render a virtualized list of commands.
To work properly, it needs some configuration passed via the `config` prop. Here is an example:
```ts
const listConfig = {
  /* The height of a single item, in Pixel. */
  itemHeightInPixel: {
    actions: 48,
    users: 48
  },
  /* The height of the container, as a string with a unit of your choice. */
  containerHeight: '21rem',
  /* The height of a group label, in Pixel. */
  groupLabelHeightInPixel: 20
}
```
::alert{type="info"}
The `itemHeightInPixel` can be an object, which contains the height of each group. Or it can be a number, which will be applied to all groups.
::

Inside the `CmdBar.List` component, you can use the following slots:
- `default`: The default slot, which is used to render the items and provides the `command` object. (See [Command](#types/command))
- `loading`: The loading slot, which is used to render the loading state and provides the currently loading `group`object. (See [Group](#types/group))


## `<CmdBar.Magnet />`
