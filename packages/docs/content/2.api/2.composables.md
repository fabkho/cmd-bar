# Composables

Discover the composable functions provided by CmdBar.

## `defineCommands()`

`defineCommands()`{lang=ts} provides type safety for your commands. It takes an array of `Command` objects and returns an array of `Command` objects.

```ts
import { defineCommands } from 'cmd-bar'

return data.value.users.map((user: Record<string, any>) =>
  defineCommand({
    id: user.id.toString(),
    leading: './src/assets/icons/user_new.svg',
    label: `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`,
    action: () => {
      // Define your action here.
    }
  })
)
```

## `useKeymap()`

`useKeymap()` let's you define your own key bindings. 

You can just pass an object with the following structure:
```ts
useKeymap({
  ArrowLeft: {
    action: () => console.log('ArrowLeft'),
    override: false // Explicitly set override to false
  },
  ArrowRight: {
    action: () => console.log('ArrowRight'),
    override: true // default
  },
})
```

Some default key bindings are already defined:
- `ArrowUp`: Select the previous item in the list.
- `ArrowDown`: Select the next item in the list.
- `Enter`: Execute the selected item.

The default settings should **not** be overwritten at this time. I am working on a solution that allows manual selection and execution of a command.
