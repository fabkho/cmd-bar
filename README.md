# CmdBarVue

## Features

### Keybindings
You can pass a keybinding object to the component to add keybindings to the command bar. The keybinding object has to be of type `Keybindings` (string must be in lowercase). Here is an example:
``` vue
<CmdBarVue :keybindings="{ arrowUp: 'arrowup', arrowDown: 'arrowdown', enter: 'enter' }" />
```
Tip: You can use the `Keybindings` type to get autocompletion for the keybindings object.
